Three full markdown files:

- graph-api-overview.md – a slim landing page that orients readers and routes them correctly

= graph-api-concepts.md – the mental models, execution semantics, and “how it works” explanations

- graph-api-reference.md – API-first, table-driven quick reference for experienced users

This structure is:

- Easy to review (clear separation of concerns)

- Friendly to both skimmers and deep readers

- Aligned with how LangGraph is actually used in production
